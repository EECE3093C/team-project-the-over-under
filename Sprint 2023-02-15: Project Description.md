# Sprint 2023-02-15: Project Description

## Vision
When designing ***The Over-Under application***, we had to put ourselves in our userâ€™s position. We asked ourselves, what do we have problems with when placing online sports bets? What problems have we grown accustomed to, and how can we improve on them?

The biggest problem we face when betting online, is finding the best **moneyline<sup>1</sup>** odds. With so many different betting websites being created, not all **sportsbooks<sup>2</sup>** can be identical. Thus, there becomes inconsistency where a better could have won more money if they placed the same bet on a different website. We decided to design a feature that will take data from major online sportsbooks, and congregate them into an organized list where you, the user, can see where to place your bet.

We not only aim to improve the accuracy of your bet, but the efficiency. Many sports betters will have several accounts logged in on multiple tabs in their browser and will flip between tabs searching for the information they need. In our application we will not only have options to sort through these databases using filters, but it will also give users instant appraisals once their predetermined budget and bet is selected. This reduces the time spent by the better significantly, as many online websites hold bets in a physical queue in-case you were to place the bet through their site. They clearly need the additional security as their site accepts bets but here, we want to see what the user can win instantly.

Our goal is to help [legal sports gamblers](https://www.americangaming.org/research/state-gaming-map/) and enthusiasts with an issue that large companies are yet to bring to the table. Current options for people now, include purchasing access to sportsbook APIs, to analyze raw data. Our application is much simpler and is designed to pull and organize data, so the application spans from beginner to experienced sports betters. The application will ensure the user makes the most profitable, and safest bet based on real-time data from major sportsbooks. 

**Moneyline<sup>1</sup>**: a bet on which team will win a game.

**Sportsbook<sup>2</sup>**: an establishment that takes bets on sporting events and pays out winnings.
