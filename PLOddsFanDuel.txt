More About the English Premier League and EPL Betting
The Premier League, the top professional league in the English football league system, consists of 20 teams. Some of the most popular teams include Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur. Similar to the season structure of La Liga, each team plays against every other team twice, once at home and once away. At the end of the season, the team with the most points becomes the English Premier League champion, while the bottom three teams are relegated to the English Football League Championship, the second tier of English football.
The EPL season starts in August and runs until May, with a break this year for the FIFA World Cup. Points are awarded as follows: 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. If two or more teams are tied on points at the end of the season, the tie-breakers are goal difference, goals scored, head-to-head record, fair play, and a play-off if all other criteria are tied.
FanDuel Sportsbook will offer tons of unique EPL betting opportunities this season. In addition to the standard Win, Lose, or Draw three-way bet on any game, you can also bet on soccer props such as Anytime Goal Scorer, Number of Goals, Number of Shots, Halftime Result, or much more. We also allow you to create parlays or Same Game Parlays with any of these bets when listed. Check out the odds for upcoming English soccer matches and good luck betting on the EPL season!
