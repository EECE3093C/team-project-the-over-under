# Electron Research

## Initial Steps
- Install VS Code
- Install Node.js

To confirm Node.js was installed type the following in your command terminal:
```console

input: node -v

output: v18.14.2

```

## Creating a .json file
Run the following command in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code terminal:
```console

npm init

```
Hit 'enter' for each prompt until you get to entery point. Set entry point as 'main.js' by typing it in and hitting 'enter'.

Let the terminal run while it creates a package.json file in your Visual Studio Code. To install electron type this command in your terminal:
```console

npm i electron

```
To confirm electron was installed type the following in your command terminal:

```console

input: electron -v

output: v23.1.0

```

Notice, a package.json file is created in your project. This project now has electron embedded into it.
